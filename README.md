# Movie-Rack
Group application by Sam Clymer, Eric Figueroa, and Matt Taliancich for real user movie reviews.

Real users will rate the movies (anonamously if they wish) in order for the truth about highly debated movies to be gathered and displayed.

After signing in users will be directed to a friendly home page. There the user can rate a movie by 
clicking on one of our "top 8", or by searching for the movie by name.

By clicking on the title of a movie the user will then be shown the results from the database.
The user will now be able to see popular ratings and be able to compare them to MovieRack's ratings 
and reviews from real Users.
